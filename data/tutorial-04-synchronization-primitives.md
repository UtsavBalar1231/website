# Synchronization Primitives

## Introduction to Kernel Synchronization

Modern kernels run on multi-core processors, where multiple execution contexts can access shared resources simultaneously. Without proper synchronization, this concurrent access leads to race conditions and data corruption.

On the Raspberry Pi 5 with its quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor, understanding synchronization is especially important for device drivers that may be accessed from different contexts:

1. Multiple user processes accessing the same device
2. Interrupt handlers and process context code accessing shared data
3. Kernel threads and user processes interacting with the same driver

  The consequences of improper synchronization in kernel space are severe: data corruption, system crashes, or hard-to-debug intermittent failures that may only appear under high load.

## Types of Synchronization Mechanisms

The Linux kernel provides several synchronization primitives, each with specific use cases:

1. **Atomic Operations**: Simple, fast operations with no locking overhead
2. **Spinlocks**: Low-level locks that spin in a busy-wait loop
3. **Mutexes**: Sleeping locks for longer-term protection
4. **Semaphores**: Counting locks that can allow multiple accessors
5. **Read-Write Locks**: Locks that distinguish between readers and writers
6. **RCU (Read-Copy-Update)**: Advanced technique for read-mostly data structures

Let's explore each of these mechanisms and understand when to use them.

## Atomic Operations

Atomic operations provide simple, indivisible operations on integers and bit fields without the need for explicit locking:

```c
#include <linux/atomic.h>

/* Define an atomic counter */
atomic_t my_counter = ATOMIC_INIT(0);  /* Initialize to 0 */

/* Increment and decrement atomically */
atomic_inc(&my_counter);               /* my_counter++ */
atomic_dec(&my_counter);               /* my_counter-- */

/* Add or subtract values atomically */
atomic_add(10, &my_counter);           /* my_counter += 10 */
atomic_sub(5, &my_counter);            /* my_counter -= 5 */

/* Read the value */
int value = atomic_read(&my_counter);  /* value = my_counter */

/* Set the value */
atomic_set(&my_counter, 42);           /* my_counter = 42 */

/* Compare and swap conditionally */
int old_val = atomic_cmpxchg(&my_counter, 42, 100);
/* If my_counter == 42, set it to 100 and return 42 */
```

### Bit Operations

For individual bits, use the atomic bit operations:

```c
#include <linux/bitops.h>

/* Define a bit field (unsigned long) */
unsigned long flags = 0;

/* Set, clear, and test bits */
set_bit(0, &flags);       /* Set bit 0 */
clear_bit(1, &flags);     /* Clear bit 1 */
change_bit(2, &flags);    /* Flip bit 2 */

/* Test bits */
if (test_bit(0, &flags)) {
    /* Bit 0 is set */
}

/* Test and modify atomically */
if (test_and_set_bit(3, &flags)) {
    /* Bit 3 was already set */
} else {
    /* Bit 3 was cleared, now set */
}
```

### Memory Barriers

On modern processors with complex memory hierarchies, memory operations may be reordered for performance. Memory barriers ensure proper ordering:

```c
#include <linux/compiler.h>

/* Full memory barrier - ensures all memory operations before this point
   are visible before any operations after this point */
smp_mb();

/* Write memory barrier - ensures all writes before this point
   are visible before any writes after this point */
smp_wmb();

/* Read memory barrier - ensures all reads before this point
   are visible before any reads after this point */
smp_rmb();
```

  On ARM64 (like the Raspberry Pi 5), memory ordering is relatively relaxed compared to x86, making proper memory barriers even more important.

## Spinlocks

Spinlocks are the simplest form of exclusive lock in the kernel:

```c
#include <linux/spinlock.h>

/* Define and initialize a spinlock */
spinlock_t my_lock;
spin_lock_init(&my_lock);

/* Basic usage */
spin_lock(&my_lock);    /* Acquire the lock (will busy-wait) */
/* Critical section - only one thread at a time */
spin_unlock(&my_lock);  /* Release the lock */

/* With interrupt disabling */
unsigned long flags;
spin_lock_irqsave(&my_lock, flags);  /* Disable interrupts and lock */
/* Critical section - protected from interrupts too */
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&my_lock, flags);  /* Restore interrupt state */

/* Non-blocking attempt to acquire */
if (spin_trylock(&my_lock)) {
    /* Got the lock, do work */
    spin_unlock(&my_lock);
} else {
    /* Couldn't get the lock, handle accordingly */
}
```

### When to Use Spinlocks

Spinlocks are appropriate for:

1. Very short critical sections (microseconds)
2. Code that cannot sleep (interrupt handlers, critical sections)
3. Protecting data accessed from both interrupt and process contexts

  Never sleep while holding a spinlock! This includes calling functions that might sleep, such as `copy_from_user()`, `kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)`, or `mutex_lock()`.

### Spinlock Variants

Linux provides several spinlock variants for specific use cases:

```c
/* Raw spinlock - even more lightweight, with fewer safety checks */
raw_spinlock_t raw_lock;
raw_spin_lock_init(&raw_lock);
raw_spin_lock(&raw_lock);
/* Critical section */
raw_spin_unlock(&raw_lock);

/* Reader-writer spinlock - allows multiple readers or one writer */
rwlock_t rw_lock;
rwlock_init(&rw_lock);

/* For readers */
read_lock(&rw_lock);
/* Read-only critical section - multiple readers can be here */
read_unlock(&rw_lock);

/* For writers */
write_lock(&rw_lock);
/* Write critical section - exclusive access */
write_unlock(&rw_lock);
```

## Mutexes

For longer critical sections where sleeping is acceptable, mutexes are preferred:

```c
#include <linux/mutex.h>

/* Define and initialize a mutex */
struct mutex my_mutex;
mutex_init(&my_mutex);

/* Basic usage */
mutex_lock(&my_mutex);     /* Acquire the mutex (may sleep) */
/* Critical section - can be longer than spinlock sections */
mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);   /* Release the mutex */

/* Non-blocking attempt to acquire */
if (mutex_trylock(&my_mutex)) {
    /* Got the mutex, do work */
    mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);
} else {
    /* Couldn't get the mutex, handle accordingly */
}

/* Timed wait */
if (mutex_lock_interruptible(&my_mutex) == 0) {
    /* Got the mutex, do work */
    mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);
} else {
    /* Lock attempt was interrupted by a signal */
}
```

### When to Use Mutexes

Mutexes are appropriate for:

1. Longer critical sections (milliseconds)
2. Process context code that can sleep
3. When you need the lock owner concept (unlike spinlocks)

  Mutexes provide better scalability than spinlocks for longer critical sections because waiting threads sleep instead of consuming CPU in a busy-wait loop.

### Mutex vs. Spinlock Rules

Understanding when to use each type of lock is crucial:

1. Use a MUTEX when:
- The critical section might sleep
- The critical section is longer (milliseconds)
- You're only in process context
- You need the concept of owner (recursive detection)

2. Use a SPINLOCK when:
- The critical section MUST NOT sleep
- The critical section is very short (microseconds)
- You're in interrupt context or preemption is disabled
- You need to protect data accessed from both interrupt and process contexts

## Semaphores

Semaphores allow multiple threads to access a resource simultaneously:

```c
#include <linux/semaphore.h>

/* Define and initialize a semaphore with count 1 (like a mutex) */
struct semaphore my_sem;
sema_init(&my_sem, 1);

/* Define a counting semaphore allowing 5 concurrent accesses */
struct semaphore resource_sem;
sema_init(&resource_sem, 5);

/* Basic usage */
down(&my_sem);       /* Decrement semaphore count (may sleep) */
/* Critical section */
up(&my_sem);         /* Increment semaphore count */

/* Non-blocking attempt */
if (down_trylock(&resource_sem) == 0) {
    /* Got the semaphore, do work */
    up(&resource_sem);
} else {
    /* Couldn't get the semaphore, handle accordingly */
}

/* Interruptible wait */
if (down_interruptible(&resource_sem) == 0) {
    /* Got the semaphore, do work */
    up(&resource_sem);
} else {
    /* Lock attempt was interrupted by a signal */
}
```

### When to Use Semaphores

Semaphores are appropriate for:

1. When multiple threads need concurrent access to a resource
2. Implementing resource counting (e.g., connection limits)
3. Producer-consumer scenarios
4. When you need finer-grained control than a simple mutex

  In modern kernel code, semaphores are less commonly used than before. For simple exclusion, mutexes are preferred; for read-mostly data, RCU is often better.

## Read-Write Locks

Read-write locks allow multiple readers or a single writer:

```c
#include <linux/rwlock.h>
#include <linux/rwsem.h>

/* Process context (can sleep): rwsem */
struct rw_semaphore rwsem;
init_rwsem(&rwsem);

/* For readers */
down_read(&rwsem);
/* Read-only critical section - multiple readers can be here */
up_read(&rwsem);

/* For writers */
down_write(&rwsem);
/* Write critical section - exclusive access */
up_write(&rwsem);

/* Non-sleeping context: rwlock */
rwlock_t rwlock;
rwlock_init(&rwlock);

/* For readers */
read_lock(&rwlock);
/* Read-only critical section */
read_unlock(&rwlock);

/* For writers */
write_lock(&rwlock);
/* Write critical section */
write_unlock(&rwlock);
```

### When to Use Read-Write Locks

Read-write locks are appropriate for:

1. Data structures that are read frequently but written infrequently
2. When read operations can safely execute concurrently
3. When you need to prioritize either readers or writers

## RCU (Read-Copy-Update)

RCU is an advanced synchronization mechanism optimized for read-mostly data structures:

```c
#include <linux/rcupdate.h>
#include <linux/slab.h>

struct my_data {
    int value;
    /* other fields */
};

/* Global pointer protected by RCU */
struct my_data *global_data;

/* Reader */
void read_data(void)
{
    struct my_data *data;
    
    /* RCU read-side critical section begins */
    rcu_read_lock();
    
    /* Access RCU-protected data */
    data = rcu_dereference(global_data);
    if (data)
        pr_info("Read value: %d\n", data->value);
    
    /* RCU read-side critical section ends */
    rcu_read_unlock();
}

/* Writer */
void update_data(int new_value)
{
    struct my_data *old_data, *new_data;
    
    /* Create new version */
    new_data = kmalloc(sizeof(*new_data), GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!new_data)
        return;
        
    /* Initialize new version (with new value) */
    new_data->value = new_value;
    
    /* Get old version for later cleanup */
    old_data = global_data;
    
    /* Publish new version (atomic pointer update) */
    rcu_assign_pointer(global_data, new_data);
    
    /* Wait for all existing readers to finish */
    synchronize_rcu();
    
    /* Now safe to free the old version */
    kfree(old_data);
}
```

### When to Use RCU

RCU is appropriate for:

1. Read-mostly data structures (reads outnumber updates significantly)
2. When read performance is critical
3. When readers cannot tolerate waiting for writers
4. For lists, trees, and other pointer-based structures

  RCU is extensively used in the Linux kernel for performance-critical subsystems like networking, but it has a steeper learning curve than other synchronization primitives.

## Practical Example: Thread-Safe Character Device

### Testing the Thread-Safe Device

To test our thread-safe device, we can write a user-space program that creates multiple threads accessing the device concurrently:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define NUM_READERS 5
#define NUM_WRITERS 3
#define TEST_ITERATIONS 10

/* Reader thread function */
void *reader_thread(void *arg)
{
    int thread_id = *((int*)arg);
    int fd, i;
    char buffer[1024];
    
    for (i = 0; i < TEST_ITERATIONS; i++) {
        fd = open("/dev/threadsafe", O_RDONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
            perror("Failed to open device for reading");
            return NULL;
        }
        
        memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
        int bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        printf("Reader %d: Read %d bytes: %s\n", thread_id, bytes_read, buffer);
        
        close(fd);
        usleep(rand() % 100000); /* Sleep up to 100ms */
    }
    
    printf("Reader %d: Completed all iterations\n", thread_id);
    return NULL;
}

        fd = open("/dev/threadsafe", O_WRONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
            perror("Failed to open device for writing");
            return NULL;
        }
        
        sprintf(buffer, "Message from writer %d, iteration %d", thread_id, i);
        int bytes_written = write(fd, buffer, strlen(buffer));
        if (bytes_written < 0) {

        }
        
        close(fd);
        usleep(rand() % 200000); /* Sleep up to 200ms */
    }
    
    printf("Writer %d: Completed all iterations\n", thread_id);
    return NULL;
}

int main()
{
    pthread_t readers[NUM_READERS];
    pthread_t writers[NUM_WRITERS];
    int reader_ids[NUM_READERS];
    int writer_ids[NUM_WRITERS];

    for (i = 0; i < NUM_READERS; i++) {
        pthread_join(readers[i], NULL);
    }
    
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_WRITERS; i++) {
        pthread_join(writers[i], NULL);
    }
    
    printf("All threads completed successfully\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Performance Considerations on Raspberry Pi 5

The Raspberry Pi 5 features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 processor running at up to 2.4GHz, which makes synchronization especially important:

1. **Multi-core Awareness**: All four cores can execute code simultaneously, requiring proper synchronization
2. **ARM64 Memory Model**: The ARM architecture has a weaker memory model than x86, making memory barriers crucial
3. **Cache Coherency**: Cache lines might be in different states across cores, affecting performance
4. **Interrupt Handling**: The BCM2712 interrupt controller routes interrupts to specific cores
5. **DMA Operations**: Proper synchronization is needed for DMA operations with the VideoCore GPU

  The Raspberry Pi 5's performance is significantly better than previous models, making it more likely to expose race conditions that were previously hidden by slower execution.

## Debugging Synchronization Issues

Debugging synchronization issues can be challenging. Here are some tools and techniques:

```bash
# Use lockdep to detect potential deadlocks
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/lockdep_enabled

# Check for mutex problems in dmesg
dmesg | grep -i lock

# Use ftrace to trace lock acquisition and release
echo function_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
echo 'mutex_*' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

# KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) for detecting race conditions
# (requires kernel compiled with CONFIG_KASAN=y)
```

## Common Synchronization Pitfalls

1. **Deadlocks**: Acquiring locks in different orders in different code paths
2. **Lock Contention**: Using coarse-grained locks that create performance bottlenecks
3. **Missing Synchronization**: Forgetting to protect shared data structures
4. **Priority Inversion**: Lower-priority task holding a lock needed by a higher-priority task
5. **Sleeping in Atomic Context**: Calling functions that might sleep while holding a spinlock
6. **Over-synchronization**: Using locks when simpler atomic operations would suffice

## Best Practices for Kernel Synchronization

1. **Document Locking Rules**: Comment which locks protect which data structures
2. **Maintain Lock Hierarchy**: Always acquire locks in the same order to prevent deadlocks
3. **Keep Critical Sections Small**: Hold locks for the minimum time necessary
4. **Use the Right Primitive**: Choose the appropriate synchronization mechanism for each situation
5. **Prefer Fine-grained Locking**: Use separate locks for independent data to reduce contention
6. **Consider Lock-free Techniques**: For performance-critical paths, explore RCU or atomic operations
7. **Validate with Tools**: Use lockdep, KASAN, and other kernel tools to verify correctness

## Conclusion

Understanding synchronization primitives is essential for writing reliable kernel drivers, especially on multi-core systems like the Raspberry Pi 5. By choosing the right synchronization mechanism for each situation and following best practices, you can create drivers that are both thread-safe and performant.

In the next tutorial, we'll explore interrupt handling and workqueues, which build upon these synchronization concepts to handle hardware events efficiently.

## Visualization of Synchronization Patterns

To better understand how different synchronization mechanisms work in practice, let's visualize common patterns:

      v              v             v
   
2. Reader-Writer Pattern (rwlock/rwsem)
   
   Reader A   Reader B   Reader C   Writer X
      |          |          |          |
      |-r_lock---|          |          |

      |          |          |-r_unlock-|   
      |          |          |          |-acquired

      v          v          v          v
   
3. RCU Pattern (Read-Copy-Update)
   
   Reader A     Reader B     Writer
      |             |           |
      |-rcu_read----|           |
      |  lock       |           |
      |             |-rcu_read--|
      |             |  lock     |
      |             |           |-create new
      |  [Read old  |           |  version

      v             v           v
```

## Advanced Synchronization Patterns

Beyond basic primitives, kernel developers use sophisticated patterns to handle complex synchronization requirements. Here are some advanced techniques:

### Lock Ordering and Hierarchies

To prevent deadlocks, the kernel establishes lock hierarchies:

```c
/* Example of proper lock ordering */

/* Lock order: subsystem_lock > device_lock > resource_lock */

/* Function that follows proper ordering */
void correct_locking_function(struct my_device *dev)
{
    /* Always acquire locks in the same order */
    mutex_lock(&subsystem_lock);
    mutex_lock(&dev->device_lock);
    spin_lock(&dev->resource_lock);
    
    /* Critical section */
    
    spin_unlock(&dev->resource_lock);
    mutex_unlock(&dev->device_lock);
    mutex_unlock(&subsystem_lock);
}

/* Deadlock detection with lockdep */
static void test_locking(void)
{
    /* The kernel's lockdep system tracks lock ordering */
    /* and warns if inconsistent ordering is detected */
    
    /*
     * DEBUG kernel console output will show:
     * ================================
     * WARNING: inconsistent lock state
     * ...
     * possible recursive locking detected
     * ...
     * other info: lockdep_depth: 1
     * ...
     * ================================
     */
}
```

### Fine-Grained Locking Strategies

Using multiple locks for different parts of a data structure can improve performance:

```c
struct hash_table {
    /* Instead of one global lock, use per-bucket locks */
    struct {
        struct list_head entries;
        spinlock_t lock;       /* Per-bucket lock */
    } buckets[NUM_BUCKETS];
};

/* Initialize the hash table with per-bucket locks */
void init_hash_table(struct hash_table *table)
{
    int i;
    
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_BUCKETS; i++) {
        INIT_LIST_HEAD(&table->buckets[i].entries);
        spin_lock_init(&table->buckets[i].lock);
    }
}

/* Add an entry to the hash table - only locks one bucket */
void add_entry(struct hash_table *table, struct entry *entry)
{
    unsigned int bucket = hash_function(entry->key) % NUM_BUCKETS;
    
    spin_lock(&table->buckets[bucket].lock);
    list_add(&entry->list, &table->buckets[bucket].entries);
    spin_unlock(&table->buckets[bucket].lock);
}

/* Lookup an entry - only locks one bucket */
struct entry *find_entry(struct hash_table *table, unsigned int key)
{
    unsigned int bucket = hash_function(key) % NUM_BUCKETS;
    struct entry *entry;
    
    spin_lock(&table->buckets[bucket].lock);
    list_for_each_entry(entry, &table->buckets[bucket].entries, list) {
        if (entry->key == key) {
            spin_unlock(&table->buckets[bucket].lock);
            return entry;
        }
    }
    spin_unlock(&table->buckets[bucket].lock);
    
    return NULL;
}
```

### Sequence Locks for Read-Mostly Data

Sequence locks provide another technique for read-mostly data:

```c
#include <linux/seqlock.h>

/* Define data protected by sequence lock */
struct protected_data {
    seqlock_t lock;
    unsigned long value1;
    unsigned long value2;
};

/* Initialize */
void init_protected_data(struct protected_data *data)
{
    seqlock_init(&data->lock);
    data->value1 = 0;
    data->value2 = 0;
}

/* Writer - needs exclusive access */
void update_values(struct protected_data *data, 
                  unsigned long new_val1, 
                  unsigned long new_val2)
{
    /* Get writer access */
    write_seqlock(&data->lock);
    
    /* Update both values atomically */
    data->value1 = new_val1;
    data->value2 = new_val2;
    
    /* Release lock */
    write_sequnlock(&data->lock);
}

/* Reader - retries if data changed during read */
void read_values(struct protected_data *data,
                unsigned long *val1,
                unsigned long *val2)
{
    unsigned int seq;
    
    do {
        /* Start read section */
        seq = read_seqbegin(&data->lock);
        
        /* Read values */
        *val1 = data->value1;
        *val2 = data->value2;
        
        /* Retry if writer changed data during read */
    } while (read_seqretry(&data->lock, seq));
}
```

## Performance Analysis on Raspberry Pi 5

The Raspberry Pi 5's quad-core Cortex-A76 processor has specific performance characteristics that affect synchronization:

## Synchronization Primitive Performance Comparison (Raspberry Pi 5)

| Primitive        | Overhead (ns) | When Contended | Best Use Case                  |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Atomic operation | 5-10          | N/A            | Simple counters, flags         |
| Spinlock         | 25-50         | High CPU usage | Very short critical sections   |
| Mutex            | 100-200       | Low CPU usage  | Longer operations, can sleep   |
| RW Spinlock      | 30-60         | Medium         | Read-heavy, short access       |
| RW Semaphore     | 150-250       | Low CPU usage  | Read-heavy, can sleep          |
| RCU              | 2-5 (read)    | None for reads | Read-mostly, pointer-based     |
|                  | 1000+ (write) | N/A            | structures                     |

## Memory Hierarchy Impact

The Raspberry Pi 5's cache hierarchy affects synchronization performance:
- L1 Cache: 64KB I-cache, 64KB D-cache per core (lowest latency)
- L2 Cache: 512KB per core
- L3 Cache: 2MB shared (higher latency when synchronizing between cores)

Cache line size is 64 bytes. Synchronization variables on the same cache 
line create "false sharing" - a major performance issue where cores 
constantly invalidate each other's cache even when accessing different variables.

## Practical Tips:
1. Align locks to cache line boundaries for high-contention scenarios
2. Group read-mostly data separately from frequently-written data
3. Use RCU for read-mostly data structures
4. Consider using per-CPU variables for truly independent data

## Common Debugging Techniques

Debugging synchronization issues can be challenging. Here are specific techniques for Raspberry Pi 5 development:

```bash
# Enable lock debugging (before loading your module)
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/lockdep_enabled

# Check lock dependencies
cat /proc/lockdep

# For deadlock issues
dmesg | grep -A 50 "possible recursive locking"
dmesg | grep -A 50 "possible circular locking"

# Memory barriers
# Use ftrace to trace memory barriers on ARM64
echo memory_barrier > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
# Do operations that might have barrier issues
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

# Detect missed spinlock releases (Pi-specific with ARM locks)
dmesg | grep "spinlock bad magic"

# For mutex problems
dmesg | grep "lock held when returning to user space"

# Check lock contention statistics (if available)
cat /proc/lock_stat   # May need lock_stat=1 on kernel command line
```

## Real-World Case Studies

Let's analyze real-world synchronization problems and solutions in kernel drivers:

### Case Study: Network Driver Race Condition

A network driver for BCM2712 (Raspberry Pi 5) exhibited intermittent packet loss 
under high load. Analysis revealed a synchronization issue:

#### Problem:
- Transmit and receive functions were using different locks
- Device reset could happen while transmit was in progress
- Statistics counters were being corrupted

#### Solution:
1. Unified locking strategy with a device-wide lock for reset operations
2. Per-queue locks for independent TX/RX operations
3. Atomic operations for statistics counters
4. Memory barriers between hardware register writes

```c
struct bcm2712_net_dev {
    /* Device-wide lock for reset and major state changes */
    struct mutex device_lock;
    
    /* Per-queue locks for TX operations */
    spinlock_t tx_lock[NUM_TX_QUEUES];
    
    /* Per-queue locks for RX operations */
    spinlock_t rx_lock[NUM_RX_QUEUES];
    
    /* Statistics using atomic operations */
    atomic_t tx_packets;
    atomic_t rx_packets;
    atomic_t tx_errors;
    atomic_t rx_errors;
};

/* Device reset function - uses device_lock */
static int bcm2712_net_reset(struct bcm2712_net_dev *dev)
{
    int ret;
    
    /* Take the device-wide lock */
    mutex_lock(&dev->device_lock);
    
    /* Reset the device - safe now, no TX/RX can happen */
    ret = bcm2712_net_hw_reset(dev);
    
    /* Release the lock */
    mutex_unlock(&dev->device_lock);
    
    return ret;
}

/* Transmit function - uses per-queue lock */
static netdev_tx_t bcm2712_net_start_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb, 
                                         struct net_device *ndev)
{
    struct bcm2712_net_dev *dev = netdev_priv(ndev);
    unsigned int queue_idx = skb_get_queue_mapping(skb);
    unsigned long flags;
    
    /* Check if reset is in progress - use trylock to avoid deadlock */
    if (!mutex_trylock(&dev->device_lock)) {
        /* Device is being reset, requeue packet */
        return NETDEV_TX_BUSY;
    }
    mutex_unlock(&dev->device_lock);
    
    /* Take queue-specific lock */
    spin_lock_irqsave(&dev->tx_lock[queue_idx], flags);
    
    /* Program hardware to send packet */
    bcm2712_net_hw_send_packet(dev, skb, queue_idx);
    
    /* Update statistics atomically */
    atomic_inc(&dev->tx_packets);
    
    /* Release queue lock */
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&dev->tx_lock[queue_idx], flags);
    
    return NETDEV_TX_OK;
}
```

### Lessons Learned:
1. Use hierarchical locking to prevent deadlocks
2. Choose the appropriate lock granularity for performance
3. Consider both protection and performance when selecting primitives
4. Be careful with device state changes during active I/O
5. Use atomic operations for simple counters and state variables
