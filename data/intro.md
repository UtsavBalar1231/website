    domain: String,
    expertise_level: ExpertiseLevel,
}

enum ExpertiseLevel {
    Beginner,
    Intermediate,
    Advanced,
    Expert,
}

let my_experience = vec![
    Experience {
        years: 5,
        domain: String::from("Linux Kernel Development"),
        expertise_level: ExpertiseLevel::Advanced,
    },
    Experience {
        years: 2,
        domain: String::from("BSP Development"),
        expertise_level: ExpertiseLevel::Expert,
    },
    Experience {
        years: 2,
        domain: String::from("Device Driver Development"),
        expertise_level: ExpertiseLevel::Advanced,
    },
    Experience {
        years: 2,
